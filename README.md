Simple script to interact with library smart contract.
This is Limeacademy validation task :

* There are two scripts for interaction with the contract: interact-lockal.ts and interact-sepolia.ts
* For local node interaction, first make sure the node is running and the contract is deployed. \
There is a prompt for contract and wallet addresses.
* For sepolia interaction, users should connect via metamask mobile by scanning the QR code.
